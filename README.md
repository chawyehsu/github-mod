3. Choose your preferred options in the settings page of the style.

**Note**: There might be some corner cases that the style doesn't work well.
If you find any, please open an issue and I'll try to fix it.

## Credits

There was a [GitHub Mod] userstyle created by synthtech. Some great features such
as fixed/floating headers switching, shadows and rounded corners removal, and
style tweaks on different `github.com` subdoamins were my favorite. I continued
on the maintenance after its repo got deleted, though most features have been
removed as GitHub evolving its UI.<sup>[Internet Archive]</sup>
